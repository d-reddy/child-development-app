# An Educational Application for Children
This is an application I used to gain some experience with angular. It is an
educational application that provides a series of sub-games for children
including math games (ie addition, subtraction), a memory based matching game,
as well as a rudimentary puzzle game.

It is currently deployed on azure at the following link:
